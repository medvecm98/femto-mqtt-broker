# Femto MQTT broker

Small MQTT 3.1.1 broker with QoS 0 support. In active development.

## Compile

Simply run:

``` bash
make
```

... in root directory. Dependencies are **libc** and C compiler (gcc or clang).
I've build this program successfully on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, Matfyz Gentoo and
OpenBSD.
